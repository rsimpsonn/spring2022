          <h1>Going to CS 0200 (aka CS200)</h1>

	  <p>CS 0111 and CS 0200 form a valid intro sequence for all CS and
	  CS-joint concentrations. You might not yet see this listed
	  in the Brown Bulletin (we are working on those edits), but
	  it has been approved in all appropriate departments.</p>

	  <p>All CS intro sequences (0150/0200, 0170/0200, 0111/0112/0200,
	  0111/0200, and 0190) prepare you for subsequent courses in the
	  CS department. The first courses are all rather different in
	  style and somewhat different in content (we bring them
	  together across by the end of the sequence).</p>

	  <p>In order to take CS 0200 directly after 0111, you need to be
	  able to work on problems at the complexity level of those in
	  CS 0170. Those problems draw on the same concepts and style
	  of programming that we do in 0111. You just need to be able
	  to scale your skills to more complex problems. We will
	  therefore offer additional exercises to help you prepare for
	  0200, most of them attached to existing 0111
	  assignments.</p>

	  <p>These additional exercises are NOT required for 0111, nor
	  do they affect your grade in 0111. They are only for those
	  who wish to take CS0200 without going through CS0112. If you
	  finish the additional work, you can take 0180 anytime before
	  you graduate (it doesn't have to be this year).</p>

	  <h2>The Assignments</h2>

	  <ul>
	    <li><p><a href="https://hackmd.io/@cs111/bridge-sorting">Sorting lists</a></p></li>

	    <li><p>Working with trees:</p>

	    <p> In lecture, we looked at using data to capture a form
	    of real-world data with a branching structure (family
	    relationships). Sometimes, we organize data into a tree
	    shape to enable a particular approach to a
	    computation. These next two assignments explore these two
	    uses of trees. You can do them in either order.

	    <ul>
	      <li><p><a href="https://hackmd.io/@cs111/filesdirs">Files
	    and Directories</a> (this is in the spirit of the problem we
	    discussed in lecture about trees that let us navigate from
	    people to their offspring).</p></li>

	    <li><p><a href="https://hackmd.io/@cs111/bsts">Binary Search
	    Trees</a> (this is a different use of trees, but you might
	    find this one easier to start with). The last problem on
	    the run-time performance can be done either as part of
	    this assignment or as a question on the running times
	    assignment below -- your choice.</p></li>

	    </ul>

	    <li><p>Running times: this is the one topic that we
	    haven't gotten to discuss in 111. There's a
	    lecture-capture video with background in the
	    handout. Kathi will also offer a session on this content
	    at some point later this semester.

	    <ul>
	      <li><a href="https://hackmd.io/@cs111/running-times">Running
	      Times</a></p></li>
	    </ul>

	    <li><p>We wrap up with two more examples of interesting
	    uses of trees, this time for capturing documents and
	    programs. Getting these conceptually will likely be more
	    challenging than the (small bit of) corresponding code.
	    <ul>
	    <li><a
		       href="https://hackmd.io/@cs111/S1_jB69qv">Processing
	    Documents and Languages</a></p></li>
	  </ul>

	    </ul>

	  <h2>Frequently-Asked Questions</h2>

	  <ul>
	    <li> <p><strong>When do I have to decide about trying for CS0180?</strong>
	    <br> We
	    will start 0180-related assignments about 5 weeks into the
	    course.</p></li>

  	    <li><p><strong>How do I sign up?</strong><br>
	    By turning in the work once it starts. There's no need to
	    formally tell us you want to do this.</p></li>

	    <li><p><strong>Where do I submit the extra
	    work?</strong><br>
	    There will be a separate assignment area on Gradescope for
	    each assignment.</p></li>

	    <li><p><strong>When will the extra work be
	    due?</strong><br> We strongly encourage you to try to
	    complete the assignments as they are released, as this
	    will help acclimate you to the workload of CS18. That
	    said, we understand that remote learning is posing its own
	    challenges for many students. You can therefore take up
	    through December 21, 2020 to turn in all of
	    the assignments. <strong>PLEASE</strong> do not leave all
	    of the work to that point. If you only start it after
	    finals, you are unlikely to finish in time. </p></li>

	    <li><p><strong>Will the extra work be doable for those new
	    to programming?</strong><br>
	    Yes. The extra work will not assume any more material than
	    what we are covering in regular 0111 lecture (with the
	    exception of one additional lecture that we will schedule
	    in November). The extra work simply uses the 111 material
	    in somewhat more complex ways.</p></li>

	    <li><p><strong>How much time will the extra work take?</strong><br>
	    Roughly an extra 3-4 hours per assignment beyond the normal
	    0111 workload. This is in line with the time requirements
	    of assignments in CS0170, which is the course that
	    normally feeds into CS0200.</p></li>

	    <li><p><strong>If I don't want to do 0200, can I still take
	    CS 0112?</strong><br>
	    Absolutely, but we won't be offering 0112 again until next
	    year (likely fall). We apologize for the inconvenience, but the
	    3-semester schedule for this year needed us to offer some
	    courses twice, which cuts into our available teaching staff.</p></li>

	    <li><p><strong>Can I take 0200 without doing the extra
	    work?</strong><br> No. Since you won't have taken 0170, you'll
	    need an override code for CS 0200. Kathi will only give
	    override codes (this year or in future years) to students
	    who have done the bridge work or completed CS
	    0112. </p></li>

	    <li><p><strong>If I took 0111 in a previous semester, can
	    I still take 0200 this year?</strong><br> Yes. Reach out
	    to Kathi to make arrangements.</p></li>

	    <li><p><strong>Is there a grade cutoff for getting into
	    CS18?</strong><br> That's not the right way to think about
	    it. The goal of these assignments is to make sure that you
	    understand the concepts sufficiently well for what 18 will
	    expect. Kathi will get a sense of that from a combination
	    of your work on the assignments, the kinds of comments
	    that come up in your reflections, interactions in office
	    hours, etc. Kathi will look at the quality of your work
	    and reflections, not at whether you were above some
	    arbitrary cutoff. </p></li>

	    <li><p><strong>Will we get grades and feedback on the
	    bridge work? When?</strong><br> You will get some feedback, but
	    it won't necessarily be the kinds of rubric-based grades
	    that you get on the regular 111 homeworks (since Kathi is
	    handling these herself, without the backup of the
	    TAs). Kathi will work on providing feedback as work comes
	    in, starting in mid-November.</p></li>

	    <li><p><strong>Where can I get help if I'm stuck on
	    these?</strong></p> Kathi has two open-access office hours
	    per week (see the 111 calendar), and is available for
	    appointments (contact her by email). Some of the TAs can answer 18 questions, but
	    as a general rule, questions on the bridge work should
	    route through Kathi (since our TA staff is primarily
	    allocated to help with 111). Kathi will be monitoring
	    Campuswire and can take questions there as well.</p></li>

	  </ul>

	  <P>Reach out to Kathi with other questions, as she will be
	  handling this part of 0111.</p>
