# CS111 Website (Spring 2022)

## Running Locally
If you would like the homepage javascript to be functional (i.e. able to retrieve currently assignments correctly),
 open a terminal at the top level of the project and run `python -m http.server` (requires python), then visit
  https://localhost:8000/index.html (if the port is set to the default port).



## TODO / BUGS
* Update staff photos
* Make all assignments tables on Assignments tables show on the same row in fullscreen desktop
