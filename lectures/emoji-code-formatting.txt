    beside(square(12, "solid", "yellow"),

# create a 3-pixel border for the base
# use the image-width to compute the border size
border = circle((image-width(base) / 2) + 3, "solid", "black")

# keep the large image so we can look at it if needed
emoji-large =
    overlay(
      overlay(
        above(eye-bar,
          above(rectangle(30, 15, "solid", "yellow"),

# scale the large image down to the size we want

# automatically show the image when we run the file
