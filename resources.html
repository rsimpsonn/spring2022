                                    <h2>Learning in Lecture and Lab</h2>

                                    <p>Lectures in the course will involve a fair bit of hands-on activities and discussion. Learning happens when someone is actively thinking about material and making connections between new material and already-known material.
                                        The lectures are designed to facilitate this, but you have to meet us halfway to make this work.</p>

                                    <p>In particular, you are expected to participate in small group discussions as they arise during lecture. Sharing ideas on problems helps both you and your classmates (in hearing and responding to ideas of others, you
                                        strengthen your own conceptions of material).</p>

                                    <p>Similarly, when we share out ideas from small groups to the class, talk and respond to each other, rather than expect the professor or staff to mediate. We'll hop in if we think a point is being overlooked, but we want
                                        to encourage discussion within the class (again, because this is how you'll learn the material better).</p>

                                    <p>In part, this means that reading notes and watching lecture capture will only get you so far. We provide these as tools for reviewing content or catching up if you have to miss a day here and there, but they will not
                                        be good substitutes for being in class and participating in the activities and discussions.
                                    </p>

                                        attention to which skills you’ve mastered and which need more practice will help you focus your time and efforts in the class.</p>

                                    <h2>Learning Tips</h2>
                                    <h3>Write code, don’t just read it</h3>
                                    <p>Learning to program involves internalizing the patterns within code: what statements are needed, where do they go, what statements are used for which tasks, etc. When you have internalized a code pattern, your brain
                                        can retrieve and reproduce it when you are given a similar problem to solve. You internalize code patterns by actually writing them down, not by reading them (writing and reading exercise different processes within
                                        the brain). This is also important because the order in which we write lines of code and the order in which we read them tend to be different. You need to practice each skill (reading and writing) independently.</p>

                                    <p><i><b>Tip:</b> When we cover new programming
                          concepts, the notes will often list some additional
                          practice problems.  Try a couple of these to help your code
                          writing come naturally, without your
                          having to look back on your notes.</i></p>

                                    <h3>View CS as learning processes, not facts</h3>
                                    <p>In some courses, you basically need to learn a bunch of facts and formulas and when to apply them. Programming is different: much of it is about learning a process of creating something or solving a problem, not about
                                        memorizing stuff (there’s a bit of memorizing stuff, but memorizing isn’t enough). Don’t expect to learn the material by reading it over and over. Instead, work on learning the steps we take and the questions we
                                        ask to make progress on problems. This goes back to the previous point: you won’t learn CS just by reading.</p>

                                    <p><i><b>Tip:</b> As you study, try to
                          articulate the steps that we took to solve each
                          problem. Don’t just try to memorize
                          solutions.</i></p>

                          learning, not testing</span> Much interesting research
                          has been coming out about the value of testing in
                          learning. When you encounter a new fact, your brain
                          might store it, but that doesn’t mean that your brain
                          can find it again. In order for you to retrieve facts,
                          your brain needs to have recalled them several times in
                          a useful context. Repeated access to factual information
                          over a period of several days or weeks is what leads to
                          long-term retention of information.  Quizzes and clicker
                          questions are designed to help you with this retrieval
                          process.</p>

                          you learn, not just a method of asssessment. Our grading

                          per-assessment averages so that you can make some
                          mistakes but still demonstrate learning a topic later in
                          the course.</span></p>

                                    <h3>Manually simulate how code runs on paper</h3>
                                    <p>We understand concepts by building models of how they work. Think of a model as a high level map that helps you see how the various pieces of a problem fit together and evolve over time. If you develop a model of how
                                        programs work, for example, then you can use the model to understand and predict how new lines of code should fit into the program. Models are also important because they can break a larger problem into the sub-parts
                                        that you need to understand to make sense of the whole problem. Working through models can help you (and us) figure out the actual part of the problem on which you are stuck.</p>

                                    <p><i><b>Tip:</b> We will show you various
                          models of how programs work and how data ties together.
                          Practice using these models for specific programs,
                          until you are confident that you understand how your
                          programs run. Bring your models to office hours if you
                          aren’t sure about how they work. Working with the models
                          targets the low-level building blocks of learning to
                          program.</i></p>

                                    <h3>Don’t believe in a "geek gene": you can learn this with practice</h3>
                                    <p>People often believe that programming and computer science is something that some people are "born" to do while others are not. At this level, this idea is false. It is true that different people absorb the techniques
                                        faster than others, but that doesn’t mean that only those with the "geek gene" can do well in CS. Approach CS as something that you can learn with practice; don’t tell yourself "I can’t do this because I’m not a
                                        CS person". There’s much interesting research on something called mindset: very roughly, it says that if you assume intelligence is fixed rather than flexible, you engage differently with material.

                                    <p><i><b>Tip:</b> Don’t fall into the trap of
                          thinking that you can’t learn this. Some of your
                          classmates have programmed before. Not surprisingly,
                          that means they are better at it than you are right
                          now. That doesn’t mean that you can’t learn to do this
                          too. Work with the practice problems and the course
                          staff.</i></p>
